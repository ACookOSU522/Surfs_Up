## Summary:
O'ahu is the ideal setting for the Surf and Ice Cream shop for travelers and local alike. June and December are temperature stable and warm enough for hanging 10 on a board and eating ice cream.
Suggestions for a deeper dive into June and December would be to check for precipitation in each month.
Two additional query suggestions would be to check for temperature ranges in October and March to forecast quarterly store operation hours to maximize profitiability.
